# MailChimpBulk 
If you need to send out a bunch of templates(as previews to specific emails) in mailchimp, you can stop wasting time right now and start being productive.

Note: currently ***only*** works on free mailchimp versions

## Installation
1. Download repository as a .zip file using git or [you can download directly](https://github.com/dev-segal/mailchimp-bulk-preview/archive/master.zip).
2. Go to the chrome-specific url: chrome://extensions
3. Make sure developer mode is enabled. If not, you can switch it on using the "slider" at the top right corner. 
4. Once developer mode is confirmed to be on, you can press "load more." This will open a file selector. You can then navigate to the rot folder of the program(default root is mailchimp-bulk-preview.zip) Once done, it should be enabled as well as working. 
5. Start testing it out!

## Feedback
If you're facing any issues with the program, I'd be glad to help. Just submit a issue and I'll get back to you on the specific subject matter. I've created templates with common details that are necessary in order to debug, etc. You can view them here: [view issue templates](https://github.com/dev-segal/mailchimp-bulk-preview/issues/new/choose)
